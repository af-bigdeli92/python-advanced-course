# Advanced Python Course

This repository contains the full teaching materials for my **Advanced Python Programming** course.  
It includes slides, code examples, exercises, and solutions designed for students who already understand Python basics and want to deepen their knowledge.

---

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced Python programming, aimed at helping students write clean, efficient, and professional-grade software. The curriculum begins with a review of object-oriented programming and gradually expands into more complex concepts including metaclasses, design patterns, GUI development, concurrent programming, web scraping, asynchronous systems, databases, ORMs, and API development.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Write advanced object-oriented code (inheritance, polymorphism, MRO, abstract classes)
- Use advanced Python features such as properties, metaclasses, iterators, generators, and context managers
- Apply creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns
- Build GUI applications with Tkinter
- Implement concurrent programs using threading and multiprocessing, and understand the GIL
- Create asynchronous applications with `asyncio` and Celery (task queues, workers, priority queues, scheduling)
- Scrape the web using Regex, Requests, and BeautifulSoup
- Send emails programmatically
- Work with SQL and NoSQL databases, including designing schemas and performing CRUD operations
- Use ORMs such as Peewee and SQLAlchemy
- Develop web applications using Flask
- Build APIs using FastAPI, implement JWT authentication, and understand REST vs GraphQL
